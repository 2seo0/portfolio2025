            <h3>From Fluid Shape to Character Identity</h3>
            <p>At the beginning, Canvally didn’t have a fixed form. I started with a soft, abstract gradient shape—an intentional choice. 
              The idea was that anyone could be Canvally. The lack of a body structure symbolised inclusivity, adaptability, and a kind of creative openness. 
              Canvally was more of a feeling than a defined character—just colour, joy, and positive energy.</p>
            <img src = "asset/dev1.png" alt = "dev1" class = "img-full"/>

            <h3>Limitations of Fluidity</h3>
            <p>However, as I began applying the character in different contexts, I encountered a challenge: expressiveness was limited. 
              Without a body structure, it became difficult to convey meaningful gestures, actions, or emotions. 
              I attempted to solve this by adding arms to the original shape, but it disrupted the balance and clarity of the form.</p>
            <img src = "asset/dev2.png" alt = "dev2" class = "img-full"/>

            <h3>Face Iterations</h3>
            <p>Parallel to experimenting with form, I also explored a range of facial expressions. 
              The goal was to give Canvally personality—without overcomplicating the design. 
              I tested different eye styles, smile shapes, and emotional combinations (e.g., wink, laugh, surprise, cry). 
              Each one helped define Canvally’s mood and tone of voice: friendly, warm, and quietly encouraging.<br><br>

              These iterations revealed that Canvally wasn’t just a symbol—it needed to become a character.</p>

            <h3>Views of Canvally</h3>
            <p>To expand Canvally’s range of motion and emotional clarity, arms and legs were added to the body.
              This simple addition enabled gestures like waving, jumping, sitting, and interacting with objects—essential 
              for guiding, helping, or celebrating with users in context.
              The limbs maintain Canvally’s softness while allowing for richer storytelling.

            <h3>Expressive, Rounded, and Brand-Reflective Design</h3>
            <p>Canvally’s final form is soft, round, and easy to connect with. 
              The bright gradient—flowing through blue, purple, pink, and orange—captures Canva’s creative spirit while feeling warm and fun. 
              With a range of expressions like happy, surprised, calm, and cheeky winks, Canvally can show emotion and respond in moments of encouragement, support, or celebration.

            <h2 id="backstory">BACKSTORY</h2>
            <h3>Beginning of Cavally</h3>
            <p>The backstory of Canvally was designed to reflect a core message of the character, 
              "Creativity isn’t about being perfect—it’s about being brave enough to try". 
              I wanted Canvally to feel more than just a cute mascot. 
              The goal was to build a narrative that could emotionally resonate with users, especially during moments of hesitation or self-doubt.
            </p>
            <img src="asset/backstory.png" alt="backstory" class="img-full"/>     
            <h3>Story development</h3>
            <P>I shaped the backstory through three emotional beats:<br><br>
              Birth: Canvally forms out of incomplete thoughts, stray brush strokes, and moments of trying.<br>
              Courage: Instead of fighting fear, Canvally embraces it - transforming it into something useful.<br>
              Impact: Wherever Canvally walks, coloIrful footprints appear - leaving the world a little brighter with every step.
            </P>

              <h2 id="context">EVERYDAY CANVALLY</h2>
              <p>Once Canvally’s personality and design were established, 
                I explored how Canvally could be meaningfully embedded into real-world user experiences—especially within Canva’s interface.<br><br>
                Rather than serving as a purely decorative element, Canvally was designed to be a gentle, helpful guide. 
                It appears at key moments in the user journey, offering timely and friendly support. 
                Each pop-up is intentional—crafted to encourage action, reduce hesitation, and create a more emotionally supportive experience.
              </p>
              <h3>Onboarding Greeting</h3>
              <p>Canvally isn’t a mascot watching from the corner—it’s a creative companion ready to solve problems with the user.</p>
              <img src="asset/boarding-guide.png" alt="boarding guide" class="img-full" />
              <h3>Doc Template Suggestion</h3>
              <p>This transforms an empty state into an invitation to act.</p>
              <img src="asset/doc-guide.png" alt="doc guide" class="img-full" />
              <h3>Drawing Shortcut Tip</h3>
              <p>It’s quick, non-intrusive help that feels like a friend whispering a helpful trick—not an instruction manual.</p>

              <h2 id="poster"> POSTER DESIGN</h2>
              <p>This poster visualises one of Canva’s six core values:<br><br>
                Be a Force for Good – Making the world a better place through positive actions, inclusion, and diversity.<br>
                Canvally, the friendly guide, is shown caring for a plant growing out of a patch of grey soil. It represents the idea that even in tough or messy conditions, small, kind actions can spark growth and change.
              </p>
              <div class="poster-pair">
                <img src="asset/poster.png" alt="poster" class="img-half poster-img"/>
                <img src="asset/mockup1.png" alt="poster" class="img-half"/>
              </div>
              <p>
                The design works both digitally and physically—ideal for posters, onboarding illustrations, 
                or value-based campaigns. It subtly communicates that positive impact can come from anyone, 
                not just through big actions but small, consistent efforts.
